# My Blog
This is a challenge from the London App Brewery. Here I am making a web-app that allows the author of the blog to add posts to a blog-site. 
The posts were originally stored in an array, and existsed only for the duration of the session. In a new udate, the posts are now stored in a MongoDB database.
